# Mental Health Check Website

## Description

More and more specialists alarm that mental health is something we need to take care for. The aim of this project is to address risk of depression, anxiety disorders, job burnout. Currently I'm building websites on which you'd be able to fill in psychological tests, assess if you are already affected and how to act if you are still in stage when self-helping methods can apply.

While building website I used Handlebars (https://handlebarsjs.com/) and Bootstrap 5.

Currently project is under construction and my main goal for now is to build website sites rendering and routing.
Next steps include writing testing logic in JavaScript, so the user can fill in psychological tests and receive feedback.

## Installation

To install packages necessary for development, use **npm install** command.

To run app on localhost:3000, use **npm run watch**. If screen shows *Cannot Get /* error and console screams about CORS policy try hard refreshing (**Ctrl + SHIFT + R**). Curretly I have no idea what causes this bug, but probably it's use of Handlebars on HomePage.
