# Mental Health Check Website

More and more specialists alarm that mental health is something we need to take care for. The aim of this project is to address risk of depression, anxiety disorders, job burnout. Currently I'm building websites on which you'd be able to fill in psychological tests, assess if you are already affected and how to act if you are still in stage when self-helping methods can apply.
